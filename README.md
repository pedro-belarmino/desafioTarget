I participated in a selective project where I had to complete several programming logic challenges. I chose to use the C language to solve these challenges, as I study programming logic with this language in my college.

The first challenge, named "TAREFA1," consisted of checking whether the number entered by the user is part of the first 15 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. 

The second challenge, named "TAREFA2," had the simple function of counting how many times the letter "A" appears in the text entered by the user.

The third challenge, named "TAREFA3," consists of calculating the percentage of a fictional revenue for each state in Brazil. This was the easiest challenge to develop.
